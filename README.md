Preface: To begin, the project is not complete from what we envisioned. We were not able to complete most of the planned functionality. The client has no interaction with what is displayed on the website and is instead
populated by predetermined calls. For example, the website will always load the subreddits from reddit : "aww, food, pics". It was intended for the client to be able to type in a subreddit which would then load the contents.
The server code has the intended functionality, but was never implemented within the client(Meaning that the server is not used in the website's functionality). We struggled with connecting the user input/server data
together in a coherent way. In the end, we were unable to produce our expected results. Within our non-build files, you may find certain .js files that are disconnected from the main contents of the program. This shows our
attempt to create such functionalities.

Expectations:

1. We attempted to create an app with a coherent purpose. (The intended app was a news feed app which would show the top 5
posts from the selected news feeds).

2. This is not a to-do list management app

3. We worked as partners.

4. All code was written by the two of us.

5. Our app has a back-end data store with functionality. The front-end client is barebones.

6. We made use of functional componenets and hooks.

7. The content of the client does not have any built in functionality.

8. Redux was used to manage state.

9. The website's ui, while minimalistic appears to be clean.

10. We used fetch calls to gain access to data.

11. We have a loading screen that appears when the data from reddit is being fetched.

12. There appears to be no errors/warnings on the console. (There appears to be an issue with refreshing on the /feed
part of the website. On localhost it works as intended)

13. Our front-end client is on github and is shared.

14. Our front-end client is available through the specified domain.

15. Our app has a working SQL database with a table storing default values.

16. We provided an express-based web service with our database. One issue was when we 
ran the ufw command to block alternate ports, we believe it did not work as we thought
it would. 

17. The web service has no client interactivity.

18. The endpoints of the webservice are appropriately named.

19. - I believe this is not implemented. (Not wholly sure what cross-origin resource sharing is)

20. The web service is run using pm2

21. The Nginx server is used for our web service.

22. Our backend is stored on github and shared.
